      <h3 class="centered">COMPANY WITH THE LOWEST LOAN INTEREST RATE</h3>

      <!-- Text Body after Subheading -->

      <p class="body-text">

          The lending space is fast rising and gradually becoming saturated, which might pose difficulty of choice amongst consumers. Nevertheless, there are several ways of filtering the list to decide which one is best.

          <br><br>

          Before choosing a loan company, there are general evaluation indicators to be considered including - Interest rate, loan tenor, turnaround time, customer service, and transparency. Though, the interest rate is the major factor determinant for customers. The interest rate plays a major role in choice of loan product decision making.

          <br><br>

          Some companies offer the reducing balance rate (interest rate on each remittance) while others offer flat rate. An understanding of these two types of interest rate would further inform an individual’s decision. This is because flat rate and reducing balance rate are not relatively comparable, so an understanding of the difference would go a long way.

          <br><br>

          However, on the long list of lending institutions, LendingCoterie stands out as the company with the lowest interest rate. Not only do they offer the lowest interest to new customers, but provisions are also made to ensure existing customers enjoy reviewed rate subsequently.

          <br><br>

          This company’s interest rate has been reviewed twice in one year, which is quite impressive and unusual- they’ve outrightly shown their devotion to solving customers dilemma on lending services.
